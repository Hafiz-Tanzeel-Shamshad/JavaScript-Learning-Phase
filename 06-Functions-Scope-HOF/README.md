# JavaScript Practice & Assignment Overview

This project contains two main folders: `Assignment` and `Practice`, each with JavaScript code demonstrating various programming concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Assignment/script.js
This file contains solutions to several JavaScript problems:

1. **Filter Array Elements Greater Than a Number**
   - Function: `getElement(arr, num)`
   - Iterates through an array and logs elements greater than a given number.

2. **Extract Unique Characters from a String**
   - Function: `uniqueStr(str)`
   - Returns a string containing only the unique characters from the input string, preserving order.

3. **Find the Longest Country Name**
   - Function: `longestCountryName(country)`
   - Accepts an array of country names and returns the longest one.

4. **Generate a Random Number in a Range**
   - Function: `generateRandom(start, end)`
   - Returns a random integer between the given start and end values.

## Practice/script.js
This file demonstrates basic and intermediate JavaScript concepts:

1. **Function Declaration and Nested Calls**
   - Function: `sum(a, b)`
   - Shows how to declare a function and call it within another function call.

2. **Function Expression**
   - Variable: `add`
   - Demonstrates assigning a function to a variable and calling it.

3. **Object Methods**
   - Object: `calc`
   - Shows how to define methods inside an object, including both traditional and shorthand syntax, and how to call them.

## Practice/index.html
This file is currently empty and can be used to test or demonstrate the JavaScript code in the `Practice` folder.
