# JavaScript Async Functions, API Requests, and JSON Practice

## Overview

This repository contains hands-on practice projects focused on modern JavaScript concepts, including asynchronous functions, API requests, AJAX, JSON handling, and HTTP verbs. The exercises are designed to help developers understand and implement real-world scenarios involving data fetching, error handling, and asynchronous programming patterns in JavaScript.

## Folder Structure

- **Practice (API Requests)**
  - `index.html`: HTML file for API request practice.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript code demonstrating API requests using various methods (e.g., XMLHttpRequest, fetch API).

- **Practice (async, await or try, catch)**
  - `index.html`: HTML file for async/await and error handling practice.
  - `script.js`: JavaScript code focusing on async/await syntax, error handling with try/catch, and best practices for asynchronous code.

- **Practice (Json Data)**
  - `script.js`: JavaScript code for working with JSON data, including parsing, stringifying, and manipulating JSON objects.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Asynchronous JavaScript
- Understanding the event loop and asynchronous execution.
- Using callbacks, promises, and async/await for non-blocking code.
- Error handling in asynchronous code with try/catch.

### 2. API Requests & AJAX
- Making HTTP requests using XMLHttpRequest and the Fetch API.
- Handling different HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- Working with RESTful APIs and understanding request/response cycles.
- Managing API responses, including status codes and error messages.

### 3. JSON Data Handling
- Parsing JSON data from API responses.
- Stringifying JavaScript objects for API requests.
- Safely handling and validating JSON data.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Open the Project**
   - Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) to open the project folder.

3. **Run the Examples**
   - Open the `index.html` files in your browser to interact with the demos.
   - Review and modify the `script.js` files to experiment with different API endpoints or async patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+ recommended)
- Familiarity with HTML and browser developer tools
- Internet connection for API requests (if using public APIs)

## Learning Outcomes

By working through these exercises, you will:
- Gain practical experience with asynchronous JavaScript patterns
- Learn to interact with APIs and handle real-world data
- Understand how to manage errors and edge cases in async code
- Become proficient in working with JSON data in JavaScript

## Best Practices

- Always handle errors gracefully using try/catch or `.catch()` for promises.
- Validate and sanitize API responses before using them in your application.
- Use async/await for cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
- Keep API keys and sensitive information secure (do not commit them to public repositories).
