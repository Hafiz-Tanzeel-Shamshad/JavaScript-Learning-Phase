# JavaScript DOM Practice and Assignments

This repository contains hands-on practice and assignments focused on JavaScript, particularly the Document Object Model (DOM), as well as related HTML and CSS concepts. The workspace is organized into three main folders:

- `Assignment/`
- `JS DOM Practice/`
- `Practice Question/`

Below is a detailed overview of what is covered and accomplished in each section.
