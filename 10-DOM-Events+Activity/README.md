## Introduction
This course is designed to provide a deep understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic, interactive web pages. You will learn how to handle user input, respond to events, manipulate page content, and build real-world applications such as color generators and text editors.

## Folder Structure
- **Lec 01 - Practice (DOM Events):** Introduction to DOM events and basic event handling.
- **Lec 04 - Activity (Generating Color Using JS):** Hands-on activity for generating colors dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Lec 06 - Practice (this in Event):** Understanding the `this` keyword in event handlers.
- **Lec 07, 08 - Practice (Keyboard Events + Form Events):** Working with keyboard and form events for richer interactivity.
- **Lec 10 - Make Text Editor (Using Change and Input Event):** Building a simple text editor using change and input events.
- **Lec 11 - Assignment:** Practical assignments to reinforce learning.
- **Lec 4.1 - Practice (Change Event + Input Event):** Additional practice with change and input events.

## Key Concepts Covered
### 1. DOM Events
- Understanding the DOM and its event model
- Types of events: mouse, keyboard, form, input, change, etc.
- Event propagation: bubbling and capturing
- Event delegation for efficient event handling

### 2. Event Handling in JavaScript
- Adding and removing event listeners
- The role of callback functions in event handling
- Accessing event objects and their properties
- Preventing default actions and event propagation

### 3. The `this` Keyword in Events
- How `this` behaves in different event contexts
- Arrow functions vs. regular functions in event handlers

### 4. Keyboard and Form Events
- Capturing keyboard input (keydown, keyup, keypress)
- Validating and processing form data
- Handling input and change events for real-time feedback

### 5. Building Interactive Applications
- Generating random colors and applying them to elements
- Creating a basic text editor with live updates
- Real-world use cases for event-driven programming

## Lesson Summaries
### Lec 01 – DOM Events Practice
- Introduction to event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- Handling click, mouseover, and other basic events
- Manipulating DOM elements in response to user actions

### Lec 04 – Generating Color Using JS
- Using JavaScript to generate and apply random colors
- Working with CSS styles via JavaScript
- Building interactive UI components

### Lec 06 – `this` in Event Handlers
- Exploring the value of `this` in different event contexts
- Common pitfalls and best practices

### Lec 07, 08 – Keyboard & Form Events
- Capturing and responding to keyboard events
- Validating form input and providing user feedback
- Preventing form submission and custom validation logic

### Lec 10 – Make Text Editor
- Using `input` and `change` events for live editing
- Building a simple text editor with formatting options
- Managing state and updating the DOM efficiently

### Lec 11 – Assignments
- Real-world problems to apply learned concepts
- Encourages independent problem-solving and creativity

### Lec 4.1 – Change & Input Event Practice
- Deep dive into `change` and `input` events
- Differences, use cases, and best practices

## Assignments
Assignments are provided to reinforce each concept and encourage hands-on practice. They cover:
- Event handling scenarios
- DOM manipulation challenges
- Building mini-projects (e.g., color generator, text editor)

## How to Use This Workspace
1. **Start with the practice lessons** to build foundational knowledge.
2. **Complete the activities** to apply concepts in real-world scenarios.
3. **Work through the assignments** to test your understanding and creativity.
4. **Experiment and modify the code** to deepen your learning.

## Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML and clean, maintainable JavaScript.
- Prefer `addEventListener` over inline event handlers for flexibility.
- Use event delegation for dynamic or large sets of elements.
- Always clean up event listeners when no longer needed.
- Test your code across different browsers for compatibility.
