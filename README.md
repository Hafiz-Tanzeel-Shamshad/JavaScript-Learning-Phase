# JavaScript Learning Phase

Welcome to the **JavaScript Learning Phase** repository! This repository is designed to help you master JavaScript through structured exercises, assignments, and mini-projects. Whether you're a beginner or looking to strengthen your fundamentals, this repo covers a broad range of topics essential for modern JavaScript development.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. JavaScript Basics
- **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**
- **Conditionals and Loops**
- **Functions (Declaration, Expression, Arrow Functions)**
- **Scope (Global, Local, Block)**
- **Objects and Arrays**
- **String and Array Methods**
- **ES6+ Features (let/const, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators)**

### 2. Strings & Arrays
- **String Manipulation:** Methods such as `trim()`, checking for blank strings, and character case checks.
- **Array Manipulation:** Methods such as `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `slice()`, `splice()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`, `indexOf()`, `includes()`, `concat()`.
- **Practice Problems:** Extracting elements, searching arrays, and working with multi-dimensional arrays.

### 3. Functions, Scope, and Higher-Order Functions
- **Function Declarations and Expressions**
- **Arrow Functions and the `this` Keyword**
- **Callback Functions**
- **Timer Functions:** `setTimeout`, `setInterval`
- **try...catch Error Handling**

### 4. Object-Oriented JavaScript
- **Creating and Manipulating Objects**
- **Nested Objects**
- **Object Methods (shorthand and traditional syntax)**
- **Access Patterns:** dot notation, bracket notation, and special keys

### 5. Coding Exercises & Assignments
- **Fundamental Problems:** Delete all occurrences in an array, count digits in a number, check for existence, basic CRUD operations, etc.
- **Practice Scripts:** Guessing game, interactive exercises in the console, nested loops, and more.

### 6. Mini Projects
- **Todo App:** A console-based todo application with features to add, list, and delete tasks via browser prompts.
- **Number Guessing Game:** Learn user input, random number generation, and logic building.

### 7. Advanced JavaScript Concepts
- **ES6+ Syntax:** Arrow functions, destructuring, spread and rest operators, template literals
- **Debugging:** Using `console.log()` effectively
- **Error Handling:** Using try...catch for robust code
